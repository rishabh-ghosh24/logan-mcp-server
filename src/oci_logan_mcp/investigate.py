    Scans char-by-char tracking single-quote and double-quote string context,
    handling OCI LA's doubled-quote escape (e.g. 'O''Brien'). Pipes inside
    quoted literals do not terminate the filter clause.

    Returns '*' for empty or effectively-unscoped inputs.

    P0 limitation (from design §2.2): only the pre-pipe clause is preserved.
    Later pipeline stages (where, eval, stats, etc.) are dropped for
    drill-down scoping.
